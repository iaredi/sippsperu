### Mapping

Spatial data mapping was done using Leaflet. This page also uses React to provide a responsive user experience. JavaScript Fetch API is used to generate dynamic SQL queries which retrieve relevant data. Extensive analysis capabilities are provided on the scale on individual measurement lines and on 25 square kilometer quadrants. Python and GDAL tools were used to tile raster data. This section is under the 'Mostrar Mapas' heading.

### Database

All data is stored in a relational database using PostgreSQL, running on a cloud based virtual machine. Spatial data is handled using the POSTGIS extension.  

### Development and Framework

Laravel was used to scaffold the views using Blade and PHP. Git and Github provided versioning. React, Leaflet, Bootstrap, and Sass were also utilized.  


### Server

The website runs on a Debian 9 (Stretch) droplet from Digital Ocean. Encryption is done using LetsEncrypt and Certbot. Apache2 serves the site to the web.
